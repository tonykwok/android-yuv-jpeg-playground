BugComponent: 42195
Owner: lajos
Local Modifications:
 * Remove files/Android.mk (it messes with the android build system).
 * Remove OWNERS files within files/ and all the subdirectories (except for
   files/fuzz). Having these files breaks repo presubmit hooks since they
   contain non @google.com email addresses.
